<h1>Tradingbot Template</h1>

<h2>Prerequisits</h2>
<p>This template is mostly made for myself, but I am adding this guide as I imagine this can be of use for other people as well. If you find this usefull, please </p>
<a href="https://github.com/jacksmithinsulander/twBotTemplate#pay-me">pay me</a>
<p>Anyway, let get into what you'll need in order to set this but template up:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A server</li>
	<li>A exchange account (or EVM wallet or something) with an API so that you can execute trades</li>
	<li>A tradingview account, unfortunatly you will have to use a payed account since you need the webhooks</li>
	<li>Some XMR</li>
	<li>A winning trading strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>DON'T use linode or anthing stupid like that. The minimum criteria for a server to be decent is</p>
<ol>
	<li>That there is no form of KYC upon registry</li>
	<li>That you can pay with XMR</li>
</ol>
<p>With these criterias in mind, the only humane alternative I've found is <a href="https://www.privex.io/">Privex</a>. If you really need me to clarify; </br> 
here you have my clarification that I am in no way associated with them. However I do think that it is vital to support organizations that truly fight for </br>
internet freedom and online privacy, and I think everyone should support them instead of stupid telemetry/KYC'd big tech, but I digress</p>
<p>Make sure to buy a VPS with at least minimum 500mb RAM</p>
